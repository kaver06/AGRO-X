## 🚀 Features

- 🦌 **Animal & Pest Intrusion Prevention**  
  Uses high-beam flickering floodlights and variable acoustic frequency generators to deter animals non-lethally.

- 🌱 **Soil Health Monitoring**  
  NPK sensors monitor nutrient levels and moisture, uploading data to a digital dashboard for monthly updates.

- 🤖 **Autonomous Rover**  
  A GPS-tracked, rocker-bogie mechanism-based robot equipped with cameras and sensors to inspect the field and gather data.

- ☁️ **IoT Integration**  
  Real-time data from soil sensors, motion detectors, and weather inputs processed via ESP32 for cloud-based analysis.
